#+TITLE: pair programming tech coffee

* History
   The Pair Programming origin is uncertain. According to the [[https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pairing/][Agile Alliance]], it dates back to the "Dynamic Duo" concept observed by Larry Constantine in 1992 and is a term highly defended and shared by agile developers over the years.
* How to do wrong
  Pair programming it’s a wonderful tool to produce code with quality and deliver fast, but it’s easy to mess things up

  1. Force pair programming on every task and for every co-worker
  2. When turning on a pair programming session, provide the solution without asking or encouraging a discussion
  3. Try to be better than your partner
* How to do right
* Jedi and Padawan
  Jedi and padawan mean a turn-based pair programming routine, it’s usually marked by a Pomodoro clock to rotate the turns, one developer is the Jedi that must watch padawan write code and stimulate questions, never pass a solution straight away because it might create a relation of dependence, when the clock ticks, both programmers switch roles and continue the development until the feature is finished.

* Ping Pong
  This routine is backed up by TDD(Test Driven Development) and it’s another kind of turn-based programming but this one won't have a watcher/coder relation, these steps are simple:

  - Developer A writes a failing test

  - Developer B write the minimal implementation to make it pass

  - Developer B writes the next failing test and the circle repeats

  This routine is always backed by refactoring the code together and constantly “pinging” the other developer to write better code.

* Jedi and Jedi
  This routine is something new Microsoft gave us, it’s not explicitly written on any book but it’s also pretty simple, consisting of both developers with a shared session on VSCode Live Share writing the same code with real-time interaction, it’s important to keep the focus while doing this routine
